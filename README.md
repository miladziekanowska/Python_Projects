# Python projects
This repository contains all my attempts at Python programs. 
Some of these are made from scratch or from different project ideas from
many places in the internet, some are made following a tutorial and 
some projects are made for FreeCodeCamp projects to gain the certification.

**! Disclaimer !**

These codes might not be optimal, there might be better or faster solutions,
but I think it's not bad for a newbie ðŸ˜„
